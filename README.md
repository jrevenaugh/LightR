# LightR

Shiny app for playing the "Lights Out" electronic board game.  
Features a variable size game board, hints and comparison with the 
optimal (least steps) solution.

This exists elsewhere as a shiny app, but I wanted the experience
of working with GA2 math in a linear algebra setting and this provided it.
And it's a fun game...
